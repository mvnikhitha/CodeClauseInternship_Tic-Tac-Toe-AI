# 🤖 Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Minimax Algorithm) 🎮

This project is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using Python. The game features an unbeatable AI opponent that uses the **Minimax algorithm** to make optimal moves. Created as part of the **CodeClause Internship**.

---

## 📌 Features

- Human vs AI gameplay (You play as **O**, AI plays as **X**)
- Smart AI that never loses (Minimax Algorithm)
- User-friendly console interface
- Detects win, lose, or draw outcomes

---

## 🧠 How the AI Works

The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, a recursive strategy that simulates all possible game states and picks the move that minimizes the possible loss. It assumes the opponent (you) will also play optimally.
